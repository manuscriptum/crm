This is a web2py plugin that allows multiple files to be added to a record. 

To install, upload using the web2py admin plugin interface.

Warning: 
	There is no indication of progress of the upload until you get the "files uploaded" flash message => avoid large files and large numbers of files.

Demo usage:

	You will see a customer edit form with an area for attachments beneath it
	Add file attachments
		Click the add button to add multiple files from the hard drive
		OR drag and drop files from a web page
	Click on attachments to download

Application usage:
	Base your view on edit.html or just use it without change.
	Create an edit controller that returns parentname and parentid (see plugin_attachment/edit as example)
